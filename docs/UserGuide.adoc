== Introduction

RestOrRant (ROR) is a desktop restaurant management application that allows *restaurant managers, waiters and cashiers* to perform *restaurant front-end operations* more efficiently. With ROR, you can easily manage table allocation, handle orders, track item availability and check restaurant statistics.

RestOrRant mainly uses a *Command Line Interface* (CLI) to perform operations, but it also boasts a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to provide you with visual information for ease of reference.

Interested? Head over to <<Quick Start>> to get started with RestOrRant!

=== Understanding the Mode system

RestOrRant operates in 4 different modes and you will start off in the default Restaurant Mode.
Each mode is dedicated to a main feature that ROR provides and comes with its own colour, display and set of commands for that feature.
You may switch between the modes by using the <<Changing Modes, commands provided>>.

The 4 modes are shown below and you may click on them to find out more information about each mode, along with the commands that are available for you in that mode.

=== Navigating the user interface

When you open up RestOrRant, you will see various components in the user interface.
While the different modes display different information that is relevant to the specific mode, the general interface remains the same
and the different components are labeled in the image below.

image:Ui_Parts.png[width="790"]

The function of each component is as follows:

. *Command Box*: This is where you can key in commands to perform operations in RestOrRant.
. *Results Display*: This is where the results are displayed after executing a command.
. *Mode Display*: This indicates the current mode that you are in.
. *Side Panel*: This panel lists information that is relevant to the mode.
. *Main Panel*: This panel displays information that is relevant to the mode.

You can find out what is displayed in the side and main panels for each mode in <<Modes and Commands>>.

[[Command]]
=== Using commands

You can use the commands described in <<Modes and Commands>> by typing them into the Command Box and pressing kbd:[Enter] to execute it.
For example, typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

Shortcuts are also provided for some commands to allow you to type faster and perform operations more quickly.
For example, you may type the shortcut `b` instead of the full `bill` command to return the bill.

[IMPORTANT]
Note that the commands need to be executed in the correct mode as some of the shortcuts perform different operations when used in the different modes.
For example, the `add` shortcut performs `addTable` in Restaurant Mode but `addToMenu` in Menu Mode.

You may need to include parameters for some commands and the format of each command is provided in the command descriptions.
You may refer to the pointers below to understand the formatting used to write the command format.

****
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you. +
e.g. in `deleteFromOrder ITEM_CODE`, `ITEM_CODE` is a parameter which can be used as `deleteFromOrder W09`.
* Items in square brackets are optional. +
e.g `serve ITEM_CODE [QUANTITY]` can be used as `serve W09 3` or as `serve W09`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times or not at all. +
e.g. `addTable NUMBER_OF_SEATS [NUMBER_OF_SEATS]...` can be used as `addTable 2`, `addTable 2 4`, `addTable 2 4 4` etc.
****

Some of the parameters have restrictions and they are stated below.

****
* `TABLE_NUMBER` has to be a whole number greater than 0.
* `NUMBER_OF_SEATS` and `NUMBER_OF_CUSTOMERS` have to be
* `ITEM_CODE` has to be in the form of an uppercase alphabet followed by a double digit integer.
* `QUANTITY` has to be a whole number between 0 and 2,000,000 inclusive.
* `ITEM_NAME` has to be
* `ITEM_PRICE` has to be
* `YEAR` has to be a 4 digit whole number within 2000 and the current year.
* `MONTH` has to be a whole number within 1 to 12.
* `DAY` has to be a whole number within 1 to 31 provided it exists in the desired month and year.
****

Some commands may make changes to the data in RestOrRant. There is no need to save manually as the data will be automatically saved in the hard disk.

=== Using RestOrRant in your restaurant

RestOrRant comes preloaded with sample data to allow you to explore and get familiar with the application.
The examples in this User Guide also make use of this data so that you can easily follow along.

When you are ready to use RestOrRant in your restaurant, use the commands in the following steps to set up and personalise ROR for your own usage. You can find out more information about each command by clicking on them.

. <<ClearRestOrRant, *`clearRestOrRant`*>>: Remove all the sample data so that you can fill it with your own restaurant's information.
. <<AddTable, *`addTable`*>> (in Restaurant Mode): Populate the tables in ROR with your restaurant's seating information by specifying the number of seats for each table, in ascending order of table number.
* For example, if your restaurant has 3 tables, and Table 1 and 2 have 4 seats while Table 3 has 8 seats, you can type in `addTable 4 4 8`.
[TIP]
You can add all the tables with just a single command!
. <<MenuMode, *`menuMode`*>>: Switch over to Menu Mode to fill up the menu in ROR with your restaurant's menu information.
. <<AddToMenu, *`addToMenu`*>> (in Menu Mode): Add each item into the menu by specifying the item code, name and price.
* For example, `addToMenu c/A05 n/Salad p/4.50` will add a new salad item to the menu in ROR.

That's it! Your RestOrRant is now ready for use. You may head on to <<Modes and Commands>> to learn more about the commands that are available for you.

[[Serve]]
==== Marking an item in an order as served : `serve`

Once you have served items to the table, you can update the serving status of those items by using this command so that you can easily keep track of what has and has not been served.

****
*Format*: `serve ITEM_CODE [QUANTITY]` +
*Shortcut*: `s`
****

[NOTE]
You can only serve item codes and quantities that have not already been served for the table. You can add items to the order using the <<AddToOrder, `addToOrder`>> command.

[TIP]
If the quantity is not specified, the default quantity served is 1.

[width="100%",cols="5%,95%", grid=none]
|===
ifdef::env-github[| :white_check_mark: a|]
ifndef::env-github[a| icon:check[role="green", size="2x"] a|]
You will see a success message in the Results Display and the order item's quantity to serve in the Order Panel will be updated. The background of the order item also turns dark once it is fully served.

a| a| For example, Table 5 initially has 4 items in the Order Panel as shown below. Note that there are still 2 Prawn Burgers that have yet to be served.

image::Order_Before.png[]

Suppose the Prawn Burgers have been served and you want to update their serving status in RestOrRant. After executing `serve W03 2`, you will see a success message in the Results Display, as shown below.

image::Serve_RD.png[]
The Order Panel will also be updated and you can see from the image below that there are no more quantities of Prawn Burger to serve. Since it is fully served, the background of the Prawn Burger item has turned dark.

[[Bill]]
==== Calling the bill of an order : `bill`

Now that all the orders have been served and the customer is ready to pay for the meal, you can call the
bill to obtain the customer's receipt.

****

This command is irreversible. Once the command is executed, all orders and the table occupancy will be cleared to allow
new customers to use the table. The money earned from the bill will automatically be added to the RestOrRant's revenue statistics.

[NOTE]
The `bill` can only be called when all order items have been served.

[width="100%",cols="5%,95%", grid=none]
|===
ifdef::env-github[| :white_check_mark: a|]
ifndef::env-github[a| icon:check[role="green", size="2x"] a|]
You will see a success message in the Results Display and the user interface will change its colour scheme and
display. +

In the new user interface, the order items in the order panel are cleared and the menu panel displays the
customer's receipt. +
The receipt will indicate the price, quantity and type of menu items ordered, along with the time, date and total bill the customer has to pay.

a| a| Given that Table 5 has 4 items in the Order Panel as shown below. Note that all items have been
served.

image::Bill_AllServed.png[]

When bill is called, the user interface changes to display the receipt as shown below:
