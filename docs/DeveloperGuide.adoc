== Introduction

RestOrRant (ROR) is a restaurant management application for restaurant managers, waiters and cashiers. ROR is designed for them to perform front-end operations more conveniently and efficiently. ROR allows them to manage tables, orders, menu and statistical data using the Command Line Interface (CLI).

This Developer Guide allows you as a developer to understand the implementation and design principles used in ROR. This guide serves as a reference for you to set up and further contribute to ROR’s development.

This Developer Guide consists of the following sections:

* <<Setting Up, Setting Up>> - Provides instructions to set up ROR in your computer
* <<Design, Design>> - Provides an overview of the architecture and components of ROR
* <<Implementation, Implementation>> - Provides implementation and design considerations of ROR’s core features
* <<Documentation, Documentation>> - Provides instructions to edit and publish documentation
* <<Testing, Testing>> - Provides methods to run and troubleshoot tests
* <<Dev Ops, Dev Ops>> - Provides tools to help build, test and release ROR

== Setting Up

This section will guide you along the process of setting up ROR in your computer.

=== Prerequisites

Before you proceed, there are two prerequisites you will need to fulfill:

. *JDK 9* or later
+
[IMPORTANT]
JDK *10* on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK *9*.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to menu:File[Settings > Plugins] to re-enable them.

=== Setting up ROR in your computer

Having satisfied the prerequisites, you can now set up ROR in your computer by following the steps below:

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click menu:File[Close Project] to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click menu:Configure[Project Defaults > Project Structure]
.. Click btn:[New...] and find the directory of the JDK
. Click btn:[Import Project]
. Locate the [.java]#build.gradle# file and select it. Click btn:[OK]
. Click btn:[Open as Project]
. Click btn:[OK] to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the *BUILD SUCCESSFUL* message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[[.java]#MainWindow.java#] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select btn:[Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options] for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[[.java]#HelpWindowTest.java#] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

To make sure that your ROR is properly set up:

. Run the [.java]#seedu.address.MainApp# and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

You should ensure that the following configurations are done to be compatible with ROR.

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to menu:File[Settings...] (Windows/Linux), or menu:IntelliJ IDEA[Preferences...] (macOS)
. Select menu:Editor[Code Style > Java]
. Click on the *Imports* tab to set the order

* For *Class count to use import with 'pass:[*]'* and *Names count to use static import with 'pass:[*]'*: Set to *999* to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For *Import Layout*: The order is btn:[import static all other imports], btn:[import java.\*], btn:[import javax.*], btn:[import org.\*], btn:[import com.*], btn:[import all other imports]. Add a blank line between each import

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the *se-edu/addressbook-level4* repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to *se-edu/addressbook-level4*), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[[.java]#build.gradle#], such as the [.java]#site-name#, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute [.java]#repoURL# in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[[.java]#DeveloperGuide.adoc#] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[[.java]#UserGuide.adoc#] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.

== Design

Now that you have successfully set up ROR, you are advised to read this section in order to better understand the architecture and its components in ROR. Knowing the structure of ROR and the interactions between its components will allow you to better navigate and modify the code, giving you a headstart in contributing to ROR.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture
The _Architecture Diagram_ given below explains the high-level design of the ROR App.

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

[TIP]
The *.pptx* files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose btn:[Save as picture].

Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[.java]#Main# has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[[.java]#MainApp#]. It is responsible for:

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,[.java]#Commons#>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* [.java]#LogsCenter# : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,[.java]#UI#>> : The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,[.java]#Logic#>> : The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,[.java]#Model#>> : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,[.java]#Storage#>> : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its API in an interface with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a [.java]#{Component Name}Manager# class.

For example, the [.java]#Logic# component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the [.java]#Logic.java# interface and exposes its functionality using the [.java]#LogicManager.java# class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `addTable 2`.

.Component interactions for `addTable 2` command
image::SDforAddTable.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

The UI component (Figure 4) handles the User Interface of ROR.

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[[.java]#Ui.java#]

The UI consists of a [.java]#MainWindow# that is made up of parts such as [.java]#CommandBox#, [.java]#ResultDisplay# and [.java]#StatusBarFooter#. All these, including the [.java]#MainWindow#, inherit from the abstract [.java]#UiPart# class. Not all the parts are displayed to the user at the same time (eg. [.java]#TableFlowPanel# is not shown together with [.java]#StatisticsFlowPanel#). The parts that are shown depends on the <<Modes, mode>>.

The [.java]#UI# component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching *.fxml* files that are in the [.java]#src/main/resources/view# folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[[.java]#MainWindow#] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[[.java]#MainWindow.fxml#].

The [.java]#UI# component:

* Executes user commands using the [.java]#Logic# component.
* Listens for changes to [.java]#Model# data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

The Logic component (Figure 5) deals with the logic behind the execution of commands.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[[.java]#Logic.java#]

*  [.java]#Logic# uses the [.java]#RestOrRantParser# class to parse the user command.
*  This results in a [.java]#Command# object which is executed by the [.java]#LogicManager#.
*  The command execution can affect the [.java]#Model# (e.g. adding a table).
*  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a [.java]#CommandResult# object which is passed back to the [.java]#Ui#.
*  In addition, the [.java]#CommandResult# object can also instruct the [.java]#Ui# to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user or changing the <<Modes, mode>> displayed.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the [.java]#Logic# component for the [.java]#execute("addTable 2")# API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `addTable 2` Command
image::AddTableSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

The Model component (Figure 7) keeps a model of the current state of ROR in memory.

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[[.java]#Model.java#]

The [.java]#Model# :

* stores a [.java]#UserPref# object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the RestOrRant data.
* exposes an unmodifiable [.java]#ObservableList<Table>#, [.java]#ObservableList<OrderItem>#, [.java]#ObservableList<MenuItem># and [.java]#ObservableList<Revenue># that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

The Storage component (Figure 8) manages the storing and retrieving of data on local files.

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[[.java]#Storage.java#]

The [.java]#Storage# component:

* can save [.java]#UserPref# objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the [.java]#Tables#, [.java]#Orders#, [.java]#Menu# and [.java]#Statistics# data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the [.java]#seedu.address.commons# package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how our features are implemented.

// tag::changemode[]
=== Mode System

==== Modes

As ROR contains many features, users may find it complicated to handle all the features at one go with so many commands to use. Furthermore, users may be overwhelmed if all the restaurant's information were to be displayed together in one screen.

As such, we have decided to implement a mode system for ROR to organise the available commands into their respective features. ROR provides 4 different modes for the users, each displaying a different set of panels that are relevant to the mode:

* *Restaurant Mode* - perform <<Tables feature, table-related operations>> across the entire restaurant
* *Table Mode* - perform <<Orders feature, order-related operations>> for a specific table
* *Menu Mode* - perform <<Menu feature, menu-related operations>> on the restaurant's menu
* *Statistics Mode* - perform <<Statistics feature, queries>> to retrieve the restaurant's statistics

To use the different features, we have also implemented mode-changing commands for users to switch between the 4 user modes.

There is also a *Bill Mode* available for your use as a developer, although the existence of this mode is not shared with the users. The Bill Mode displays the receipt and is only used after the `bill` command is executed in RestOrRant.

[NOTE]
Although the `bill` command is used in Table Mode, it is considered a Statistics feature rather than an Orders feature as it involves calculation for the revenue.

==== Current Implementation

===== Changing modes in general

The modes of the application are defined using a [.java]#Mode# enum and the current mode of the application is stored as a private attribute [.java]#Mode mode# in [.java]#LogicManager#. Users can switch between modes in ROR using the `{XXX}Mode` command, such as `menuMode` and `tableMode`. When the mode of the application is changed, we need to update the:

* [.java]#Logic# component so that the [.java]#mode# attribute in [.java]#LogicManager# reflects the new current mode, since this is used to check if a command can be executed,
* [.java]#UI# component so that the panels display the information that is relevant to the mode.

For all the mode-changing commands, these updates are done using a new [.java]#toMode# attribute added to the [.java]#CommandResult# object. As an example, the figure below shows the sequence diagram for when a user executes the `menuMode` command:

.Component interactions for `menuMode` command
image::MenuModeSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Upon execution of the `menuMode` command, [.java]#MenuModeCommand#generateCommandResult()# will generate a [.java]#CommandResult# whose [.java]#toMode# attribute is set to [.java]#MENU_MODE# and return it to the [.java]#LogicManager#. Now, the updates can be done for the respective components:

* [.java]#Logic# component: [.java]#LogicManager# calls [.java]#CommandResult#newModeStatus()# to retrieve the mode to be changed to and updates the current mode stored in its [.java]#mode# attribute by calling [.java]#LogicManager#changeMode()#. The [.java]#CommandResult# is passed to [.java]#MainWindow# in UI.
* [.java]#UI# component: [.java]#MainWindow# calls [.java]#CommandResult#newModeStatus()# to retrieve the mode to be changed to and updates the display panels by calling [.java]#MainWindow#handleChangeMode()#.

[NOTE]
For commands that do not involve a change in mode, [.java]#CommandResult#newModeStatus()# will return [.java]#null# and no updates to the current mode or display will be done.

[[ChangeToTableMode]]
===== Changing to Table Mode for a specific table
All the mode-changing commands take no parameters except for Table Mode. When the user wants to perform order-related operations (eg. add an item to the table's order), the user will first have to switch to Table Mode by typing the `tableMode` command (or its shortcut command `TM`) followed by the table number of the table that the user wants to perform actions on.

[NOTE]
The `tableMode` command can be used from any mode, even in Table Mode of a different table number. If the application is already in Table Mode of the same table number, or if the table specified by the table number is unoccupied, an error message will be shown to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows the relevant parts of what happens when a user executes the `tableMode 3` command:

.Component interactions for `tableMode 3` command
image::TableModeSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The [.java]#Logic# and [.java]#UI# component interactions work in a similar way to the other mode-changing commands and the implementation is mentioned above. The only difference is the parsing of the argument *3* into a [.java]#TableNumber# object that indicates the table number of the target table to switch to. This [.java]#TableNumber# object is stored as an attribute in [.java]#`TableModeCommand#.

Let's focus on what happens to the [.java]#Model# component when the [.java]#TableModeCommand# is executed. The relevant parts of the sequence diagram has been extracted out and shown in the diagram below.

.Interaction between Logic and Model components for `tableMode 3` command
image::TableModeModelSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

It first retrieves the [.java]#Table# that corresponds to its [.java]#TableNumber# attribute. This is done by going through [.java]#Model#getRestOrRant()# to obtain the [.java]#ReadOnlyRestOrRant#, whose [.java]#getTables()# method can be called to retrieve [.java]#ReadOnlyTables# that contains the list of all the tables in the restaurant. The [.java]#Table# can then be retrieved by passing [.java]#TableNumber# into [.java]#ReadOnlyTables#getTableFromNumber()#.

The [.java]#Table# is then set as the selected table in [.java]#Model# using [.java]#Model#setSelectedTable()#. This is to keep track of the current table so that the Table Mode commands like `addToOrder` and `bill` can easily perform their operations by getting the table from [.java]#Model#getSelectedTable()#.

After which, [.java]#Model#updateFilteredOrderItemList()# is called to update the filtered list such that it only contains order items ordered by the chosen table. This will then update the item list panel in the UI to display only the order items that were ordered by the chosen table.

==== Design Considerations

[width="90%",cols="20%,40%,40%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Aspect | Alternative 1 | Alternative 2
| Defining of modes
| Modes are defined using a [.java]#Mode# enum. +
- *Pros*: Easily identify incorrect modes since the set of valid modes is restricted to the enum values. +
- *Cons*: Need to create a new class and increases coupling between Logic and UI components.

We decided to choose this option as the enum is an abstraction over the possible modes. Apart from being less prone to errors,
it also makes the code more readable as the enum values explicitly state the name of the mode (eg. [.java]#TABLE_MODE#, [.java]#MENU_MODE#) and are stored
in [.java]#Mode# variables, making it clear that it refers to a mode and not just any string.
| Modes can be defined with strings (eg. "TableMode") or integers. +
- *Pros*: Easy to implement. +
- *Cons*: May be prone to errors (eg. mistyping a string) that causes bugs in the code. +

| Storing of current mode
| Mode stored in the Logic component ([.java]#LogicManager#). +
- *Pros*: Easy to access the current mode to check whether a command is valid to execute in a particular mode. +
- *Cons*: Slightly breaks abstraction since mode is not purely related to command execution.

We decided to store the current mode in Logic because we note that most of the work that requires access to the current mode is done here, so providing a quick access will be more efficient.
The Model component does not need to know what the current mode is at all, so it would be better to keep the coupling low to facilitate integration.

| Mode stored in the Model component ([.java]#ModelManager#). +
- *Pros*: Maintains abstraction as the mode is part of the current state of the application, which is maintained in Model. +
- *Cons*: Increases coupling among the Model, Logic and UI components. +

| Specifying table number for Table Mode commands
| Table number specified once when switching to Table Mode, then retrieved from [.java]#Model#getSelectedTable()# for future commands. +
- *Pros*: Convenient to retrieve table number without having to explicitly specify it in every command. +
- *Cons*: Non-standardized mode-changing commands since the others do not have any parameters.

We decided to go ahead with this implementation as we feel that from a user's point of view, it would be more convenient to be able to just specify the table number once and then perform a series of operations afterwards. Furthermore, having to parse the table number for every command will also do more work.

| Table number specified for every command (eg. `addToOrder 3 W09 1` to add 1x W09 to table 3). +
- *Pros*: All mode-changing commands are simple and similar. +
- *Cons*: Makes the commands longer to type.

|=======================================================================

// end::changemode[]

=== Tables feature

// tag::editpax[]
[[EditPax]]
==== Edit pax at a table
===== Current Implementation

The edit pax mechanism is facilitated by `UniqueTableList`. It stores the all tables currently in the system and ensures that there are no duplicated tables. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `UniqueTableList#contains(targetTable)` -- Checks if the target table exists within the unique list of tables.
* `UniqueTableList#setTable(targetTable, editedTable)` -- Replaces the target table in the list with the new table with the updated `TableStatus`.

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as `Model#setTable(targetTable, editedTable)` and `Model#hasTable(targetTable)`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit pax mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `UniqueTableList` will be initialised to be empty.

image::EditPaxStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `addTable 4` command to add a table to the RestOrRant application. Since it is the first new table, it will be labelled table `1` and not be occupied thus having a table status of `0/4`. The `UniqueTableList` will now contain 1 table.

image::EditPaxAddTableStateListDiagram.png[width="800]

Step 3. The user then has 4 customers enter his/her restaurant and executes `editPax 1 4` command to update the table labelled 1 with 4 customers. The `editPax` command calls `Model#setTable(targeTable, editedTable)`, causing the RestOrRant to create a new table with the updated `TableStatus` and replace the current target table in the UniqueTableList. At this point, the UniqueTableList still has only 1 table the original table was replaced by the updated table. The `Storage` detects this change in the UniqueTableList and also updates itself.

image::EditPaxEditPaxStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit pax operation works:

image::EditPaxSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the table to be edited does not exist in the `UniqueTableList`, the application returns an error to the user rather than attempting to replace the non existent table.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::EditPaxActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

===== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: How edit number of customers executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Replace the entire table with an updated table.
** Pros: Maintains abstraction of `Table` and `TableStatus` and reduce errors from abusing the editability of `TableStatus` in `Table`.
** Cons: May have efficiency issues when creating a whole new object whenever part of it needs to be changed.
* **Alternative 2:** Directly edit the `TableStatus` of the tables.
** Pros: Potentially more efficient as there is no need to create new object and replace items in a list.
** Cons: Breaks abstraction to a certain extent and allows future developers to abuse the object.

// end::editpax[]

=== Orders feature

The Orders feature allows restaurant front-end staff to take orders from customers using the <<AddToOrder, `addToOrder`>> command,
as well as remove incorrectly inputted orders using the <<DeleteFromOrder, `deleteFromOrder`>> or <<ClearOrder, `clearOrder`>> commands.
They can track the current list of items ordered for each table (in Table Mode) or across all tables (in Restaurant Mode) and update their serving statuses with the <<Serve, `serve`>> command.

[[CurrentTable]]
==== Getting the table number

The Orders feature allows users to perform order-related operations for a specific table. The table number was specified when <<ChangeToTableMode, switching over to Table Mode>>.

[NOTE]
The table number is stored so that users do not need to keep specifying it when typing the commands.

Hence, all the commands in the Orders feature will have to retrieve the table number from [.java]#Model# first before they can perform their functions. The current table is stored as a [.java]#Table# object in [.java]#Model#, which is retrieved by calling [.java]#Model#getSelectedTable()#.
The [.java]#TableNumber# can then be retrieved from that [.java]#Table#. The sequence diagram for this operation is shown below.

.Sequence diagram for retrieving the table number
image::CurrentTableSequenceDiagram.png[width="500"]

[[AddToOrder]]
==== Adding to an order

The interaction between the components for this function is similar to <<AddToMenu, adding to menu>>. A key difference in function is that `addToMenu` only adds 1 menu item each time, but `addToOrder` allows multiple and duplicate items to be added in a single command.

Order items are stored in a list. When `addToOrder W09 3 W12 1` is keyed in, the command is parsed by [.java]#AddToOrderCommandParser# to check if the arguments are in valid format. They are then converted into a list of [.java]#Code# item codes and a list of [.java]#Integer# quantities, which are stored in the [.java]#AddToOrderCommand# object returned by the parser.

When [.java]#AddToOrderCommand#execute()# is called, the item codes in the [.java]#Code# list are processed one by one.
For each item code, the [.java]#MenuItem# with the [.java]#Code# will be retrieved from the [.java]#Model# component to check if it exists in the menu. Otherwise, an error is returned and the subsequent item codes in the list are not processed.

If the item is found in the menu, it will then attempt to find an [.java]#OrderItem# with the same [.java]#Code# in the current table. If an order of that item already exists, the quantity will be updated in the list using [.java]#Model#setOrderItem()#. Otherwise, the new item will be added to the list using [.java]#Model#addOrderItem()#.

[[DeleteFromOrder]]
==== Deleting from an order




[[ClearOrder]]
==== Clearing an order

===== Current Implementation

When the user enters the `clearOrder` command, the command is parsed and a [.java]#ClearOrderCommand# object is created.

[.java]#ClearOrderCommand#execute()# is then called, which in turn calls [.java]#Model#clearOrderItemsFrom()# with the <<CurrentTable, current table number>>.
In fact, [.java]#Model# acts as a facade and forwards the call to [.java]#Orders#clearOrderItemsFrom()#. That method's source code is replicated below.

[source, java]
----
public void clearOrderItemsFrom(TableNumber tableNumber) {
        ArrayList<OrderItem> itemsToDelete = new ArrayList<>();
        for (OrderItem orderItem : orderItems) { // <1>
            if (orderItem.getTableNumber().equals(tableNumber)) {
                itemsToDelete.add(orderItem);
            }
        }
        for (OrderItem item : itemsToDelete) { // <2>
            orderItems.remove(item);
        }
        indicateModified(); // <3>
    }
----

In the method above, [.java]#orderItems# is a [.java]#UniqueOrderItemList# that contains all the order items from all the tables. Let's walk through this method to see how the main functionality of `clearOrder` is implemented:

<1> It first loops through all the items in the [.java]#UniqueOrderItemList# and retrieves the items with the current table number.
<2> It then deletes these items from the [.java]#UniqueOrderItemList#.
<3> Finally, it triggers the listener in [.java]#Orders# to indicate that the order item list has been modified. This signals to the [.java]#LogicManager# to update the storage data files by calling [.java]#Storage#saveOrders()#.

The sequence diagram for when a user executes the `clearOrder` command is shown below.

===== Design Considerations

[width="90%",cols="20%,40%,40%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Aspect | Alternative 1 | Alternative 2
| Storing of order items
| The order items from all the tables in RestOrRant can be stored in a single [.java]#UniqueOrderItemList#. +
- *Pros*: Easier to handle a single list. +
- *Cons*: `clearOrder` needs to iterate through the entire list to delete the order items from the specific table.

We decided to choose this option because we realise that customers are unlikely to order a large number of items in a single table, so it would not be space efficient to create so many [.java]#UniqueOrderItemList#.
Furthermore, it also provides the benefit of arranging the order items across all the tables based on when they were ordered without keeping an extra time attribute. This provides the useful functionality of seeing which orders should be fulfilled first in Restaurant Mode.
| Each table has its own [.java]#UniqueOrderItemList# to store the order items for that table. +
- *Pros*: `clearOrder` will just need to create a new empty [.java]#UniqueOrderItemList# to replace the existing one. +
- *Cons*: Difficult to keep track of so many lists. May be space inefficient to create multiple [.java]#UniqueOrderItemList# if each list only has a few items. +

[[Serve]]
==== Serving items in an order

The interaction between the components for this function is similar to <<EditPax, editing the occupancy at a table>>.

Suppose 3 "W09 Chicken Wings" has been ordered by the current table. When `serve W09 2` is keyed in, the command is parsed by [.java]#ServeCommandParser# to check if the arguments are in valid format. The valid [.java]#Code# item code and [.java]#Integer# quantity are then stored in the [.java]#ServeCommand# object returned by the parser.

When [.java]#ServeCommand#execute()# is called, it will use the item code to check whether the item code exists in the menu and in the current table's order.
If the order item is found and the quantity served is valid, a new [.java]#OrderItem# object will be created with a new [.java]#OrderItemStatus# that reflects the new quantities.
[.java]#Model#setOrderItem()# is then used to replace the old [.java]#OrderItem# object with the new one.


=== Menu feature

// tag::addtomenu[]
[[AddToMenu]]
==== Adding to menu
===== Current Implementation

The menu items in the menu are stored as a list. Adding a new menu item to the menu is done by adding to the existing list.

The command is read as a text string from the command box and then is executed by calling `executeCommand`, which passes this string to the Logic component by calling `execute`.

The `execute` method in the logic component then creates a command from the text string input by parsing the string to identify the command word (done by the `parse` method in the `RestOrRantParser` class) and other parameters, in this case the details of the menu item (done by the `parse` method in the `AddToMenuCommandParser` class). The text string is then converted to Name, Code, and Price after parsing and then passed to Model component.

In the model component, the validity of the name, code and price of the menu item is checked, and the menu item is only added to the current menu items list if all three parameters are valid (i.e. in the specified format). The new menu item is added to the list in the Model component after ensuring that the menu item does not already exist in the list and that it does not have the same name and code as another menu item already in the list.

After adding to the list in the Model component, the `indicateModified` method is called, which then triggers the Logic component to save the menu, by calling `saveMenu` in the Storage Component.

The User Interface also updated by adding the new menu item to the list panel.

[NOTE]
This action can only be done in Menu Mode. If not in Menu Mode currently , users can first change mode by typing `MenuMode` or `MM` in the command box.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `addToMenu` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes the `addToMenu` command by typing the name, code and price of the menu item (e.g.: `addToMenu n/French Fries c/W12 p/2.50`).

Step 2. After ensuring that all parameters is valid and that the new menu item is unique, the change is reflected in the User Interface, where the list panel displays the newly added menu item. A success message is also displayed to the users at the Results Display box.

===== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: Saving changes from `AddToMenu` command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves only the menu.
** Pros: Uses less memory as any update to the menu will only save the menu. This is implemented by adding a listener to menu, which detects any changes to the menu when the `indicateModified` method is called. This then triggers Storage component to save the state of the menu.
** Cons: An increase in the number of variables during runtime, as every feature will need a listener and a boolean (for instance, menu feature would have a listener and a boolean `menuModified` to trigger call storage#saveMenu() when the boolean evaluates to true).

* **Alternative 2:** Save the whole restaurant instance.
** Pros: Fewer variables during runtime, easier to call just one boolean upon any change to restaurant features.
** Cons: There is no need to save another feature if only menu is being updated, may cause lagging instead of improving performance.

The pros outweighs the cons as despite the number of variables during runtime, in the long run saving every instance of the restaurant would cause bigger performance issues such as lagging especially if there are constant and multiple changes to every feature of the restaurant. This implementation is also more scalable for future developments.

// end::addtomenu[]

=== Statistics feature

// tag::bill[]
[[Bill]]
==== Billing an order
===== Current Implementation

The Bill mechanism can only be executed under the `TableMode`. After which, it switches to `BillMode` which changes the UI to display a receipt of the bill specific to the table selected in TableMode.

The main crust of Bill mechanism is implemented in `BillCommand`. `BillCommand#execute()` overrides `Command#execcute()` which is called in `LogicManger`. It takes in the current mode, model and command history which will provide the necessary functions it will need to execute the command properly.

Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `BillCommand#calculateBill()` -- Calculates the total bill from the order list that is unique to a table.
* `BillCommand#updateDailyRevenue()` -- Either saves the bill as a new `DailyRevenue`  or updates the `DailyRevenue` that is existing in its Statistics storage.
* `BillCommand#updateStatusOfTable()` -- Updates the status of the table to indicate that it is empty.
* `BillCommand#updateOrderList()` -- Clears the order list to prepare for the next customer.

The `bill` or `b` command is executed in 2 simple steps. Given below is an example usage scenario and how the bill mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. Users are only allowed to use the `bill/b` command in *TableMode*. When they enter the `TableMode 1` command, the program calls for `Model#setselectedTable()` to set the current table to Table 1 and change the UI display to the menu and the table’s list of orders as shown below:

image::TableMode.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `bill` command to bill the orders of the current Table. The `bill` command gets the details of the current table using `Model#getSelectedTable()` and checks that the table exists. If it is true that the table exists, it calls both `Model#getFilteredOrderItemList` and `ReadOnlyRestOrRant#geMenu()` to obtain the table’s list of orders and the restaurant’s menu to pass into `BillCommand#calculateBill()`.

`BillCommand#calculateBill()` will iterate through the `orderItemList` to obtain individual `orderItems` and execute the following in each iteration:
* Obtain the `menuItem` by passing the code of the OrderItem into `Menu#getItemFromCode`.
* Create a `Receipt` that appends the `MenuItem#getCode()`, `MenuItem#getName()`, `MenuItem#getPrice()` and `OrderItem#getQuantity()`.
* Add the price of each dish multiplied by the quantity ordered to the bill.

After the iterating through the `orderItemList`, the receipt will append the final calculation of the total bill and the function will return a new Bill that contains the updated `tableNumber`, `totalBill` and `receipt`. This new Bill will be assigned as the recent bill that was created via `Model#setRecentBill()`. Format of the receipt should be as follows:

image::BillReceipt.png[width="300"]

Now that the bill is calculated, the `BillCommand` has to store the calculated data in the `Statistics` storage. If a `DailyRevenue` with the same `Day`, `Month` and `Year` exists in the `DailyRevenueList`, the program calls `BillCommand#updateDailyRevenue()` to add the total bill to the recorded total daily revenue. On the other hand, if no matching Daily Revenue is found, the program will create a new Daily Revenue from the details of the new bill and store it in the statistics storage using `Model#addDailyRevenue`.

`BillCommand#updateStatusOfTable()` takes in the `Model` as an argument and creates a new Table with the updated `TableStatus`. This is done by calling `TableStatus#changeOccupancy(). After which, `Model#setTable()` is called to replace the current `Table` with the new `Table` that has the updated `TableStatus`.


Lastly, `BillCommand#updateOrderList` is called to empty the order list of the current `Table`. Below is illustrates the final result that derived from executing the `bill` command.

image::BillMode.png[width="650"]


Step 3. Once the user is in BillMode, they can change their execute any commands that are related to StatisticsMode or manually change their mode to `Restaurant Mode`, `TableMode` and `MenuMode`.

[NOTE]
The command will not execute the functions stated above until it has confirmed that the user is in `TableMode` and the current table exists.
* If the user is in the wrong mode, the program will return a `CommandException` with the message “Incorrect Mode, unable to execute command. Enter tableMode.”.
* If the current table does not exist, the program will return a `CommandException` with the message “This table does not exist.”.


The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a the `bill` command:

=== Logging

We are using [.java]#java.util.logging# package for logging. The [.java]#LogsCenter# class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the [.java]#logLevel# setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The [.java]#Logger# for a class can be obtained using [.java]#LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)# which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: *Console* and to a *.log* file.

*Logging Levels*

* [.java]#SEVERE# : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* [.java]#WARNING# : Can continue, but with caution
* [.java]#INFO# : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* [.java]#FINE# : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: [.java]#config.json#).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render *.adoc* files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your *.adoc* files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the [.java]#docs/# directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the [.java]#build/docs# folder, right click on them and select menu:Open with[Google Chrome].
.  Within Chrome, click on the btn:[Print] option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to btn:[Save as PDF], then click btn:[Save] to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[[.java]#docs/stylesheets#] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[[.java]#docs/templates#] controls the rendering of *.adoc* files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[[.java]#docs/templates#] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the [.java]#src/test/java# folder and choose btn:[Run 'All Tests']
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose btn:[Run 'ABC']

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the [.java]#systemtests# package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in [.java]#seedu.address.ui# package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. [.java]#seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest#
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. [.java]#seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest#
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. [.java]#seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest#


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: [.java]#HelpWindowTest# fails with a [.java]#NullPointerException#.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, [.java]#HelpWindow.html# in [.java]#src/main/resources/docs# is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[[.java]#MainApp.java#].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. *v0.1*
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, RestOrRant depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* has a need to manage the front-end operations of a restaurant (customers, orders, menu)
* still uses outdated front-end restaurant management systems like pen and paper
* wants to easily keep track of restaurant statistics (revenue, dishes’ popularity)
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing over mouse input
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

*Value proposition*: RestOrRant manages the customers, orders, menu and restaurant statistics with a speed faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven application. This allows the user to have a clear idea of the current status of the restaurant without the need to physically check out the space. This is especially useful for busy restaurants with unorganised or slow front-end management systems.
